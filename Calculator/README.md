# ⏪ **Calculator** ⏩
## **Case**: 
In this task I propose that you create your own calculator.
The special feature of this calculator will be to dynamically calculate an expression that is entered by the user.

**In the files of this case study I have provided an unfinished solution which you need to modify and refine**.

What needs to be refined:
1. Add buttons to calculate percentages and a "+/-" button
2. Add the ability to calculate a number in exponential form.
3. Limit numbers larger than 15 digit

**Bottom line**: An unfinished example solution.
