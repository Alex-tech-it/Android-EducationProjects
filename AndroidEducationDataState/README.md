# ⏪ **Group Students** ⏩
## **Case**: 
In this task I propose that you create an application to store information about the students in the group.

**Main functionality:** 
1. Adding a student with the following characteristics: full name, gender, preferred programming languages and preferred IDE; 
2. Ability to edit and delete the record;
3. Displaying all students on the screen.

**Points:**
1. The output of all students on the main screen is done by RecyclerView, can use the code that is specified in the ready solution. 
2. It also needs to be implemented to be able to save the data when the screen orientation changes (delete activity)

**In the files of this case study I have provided an unfinished solution which you need to modify and refine**.

**Bottom line**: An unfinished example solution.
